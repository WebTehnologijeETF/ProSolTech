                <h2>Our History </h2>
                    <p>Blazer Electric Supply was originally formed in 1984 by Fred, Mike, and Steve Blazer. The company grew from a small start-up in Colorado Springs to the largest electrical distributor in Southern Colorado in just 15 years with locations in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Canon City and Castle Rock. The company was then sold in 1999.

                   Recognizing the void in the marketplace of a locally-owned electrical distributor, Mike and Steve then rebuilt a new company in 2009 with the help of 30 former employees.  In less than 5 years, Blazer Electric Supply once again established itself as the largest electrical distributor in Southern Colorado. Our customers can access 4 million dollars in inventory under 80k square feet of warehouse, serviced by over 75 of the most customer service oriented associates in our industry. Blazer is back.</p>
                <h2>Our Independence</h2>
                     <p>Blazer Electric Supply is Southern Colorado’s only locally owned independent distributor. That independence translates into a distributor that is flexible, progressive and responsive, with a single objective of offering the highest levels of customer service to those that we serve. We value our employee, supplier and customer relationships and are committed to supporting the communities within which we live.</p>
                <h2>Our Success</h2>
                    <p>Over the years Blazer Electric Supply has been recognized for numerous accomplishments, having received the Better Business Bureau’s “Excellence in Customer Service” Award, the Chamber of Commerce “Small Business of the Year” Award and most recently the IMARK “Distributor of the Year” Award for 2011, 2012, and 2013. But our true measure of success comes from our customers, as demonstrated in a recently completed market survey by Farmington Consulting Group, a nationally recognized customer satisfaction survey firm, in which Blazer Electric Supply ranked 2nd of over 50 distributors surveyed to date.</p>
                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you’re looking for a distributor that has the History to give you the assurance of doing business with a credible and reliable supplier, the Independence to be able to respond to each customer’s individual needs and the proven track record of Success to meet the requirements of not only today’s, but tomorrow’s business dynamics ……..
